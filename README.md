# To-Do List Application

# Project Overview

  In the fast-paced world we live in, keeping track of tasks and responsibilities is crucial. The To-Do List Application is designed to simplify task management by offering a streamlined and intuitive tool for organizing your daily activities. It provides a RESTful API for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving To-Do items. The application uses Elasticsearch for efficient search and retrieval of To-Do items.

# Key Features

- Efficient Task Management: The application allows users to create, retrieve, update and delete To-Do items effortlessly. 
- Priority Levels: Each task is associated with priority levels, allowing for easy categorization and prioritization. Priority levels include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, and URGENT.
- Status Tracking: Keep track of task statuses such as CREATED, COMPLETED, POSTPONED, and DELETED, facilitating organized task management.
- Search and Retrieval: Powered by Elasticsearch, the backend provides advanced search capabilities, allowing for the retrieval of tasks based on various criteria.

# Technology stack
  The To-Do List Application leverages modern technologies to ensure a robust and scalable backend:
- Spring Boot with Java 17: A powerful and flexible framework for building Java-based applications, providing a solid foundation for the To-Do List API.
- Kafka: A distributed event streaming platform that enhances communication between different components, ensuring real-time updates and seamless integration.
- PostgreSQL: A reliable relational database for storing and managing task data securely.
- Docker: Simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments by containerizing the application.
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat): Elasticsearch powers the search functionality, Logstash aids in data processing, Kibana offers visualization, and Filebeat handles log file shipping.
